To find the probability that the sum of two six-sided dice is at most 9, we need to consider all the possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is less than or equal to 9.

### Step 1: Total Possible Outcomes
Each die has 6 faces, so when rolling two dice, the total number of possible outcomes is:
\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]
This is the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice.

### Step 2: Favorable Outcomes
Now, we need to count the outcomes where the sum of the two dice is at most 9. Let's list the possibilities for each sum:

- Sum = 2: (1, 1)
- Sum = 3: (1, 2), (2, 1)
- Sum = 4: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
- Sum = 5: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)
- Sum = 6: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1)
- Sum = 7: (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1)
- Sum = 8: (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2)
- Sum = 9: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3)

### Step 3: Count the Favorable Outcomes
Counting all these outcomes, we have:
- 1 outcome for sum = 2
- 2 outcomes for sum = 3
- 3 outcomes for sum = 4
- 4 outcomes for sum = 5
- 5 outcomes for sum = 6
- 6 outcomes for sum = 7
- 5 outcomes for sum = 8
- 4 outcomes for sum = 9

The total number of favorable outcomes is:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 30
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Probability
The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{30}{36} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

Thus, the probability that the sum of two dice will be at most 9 is \(\frac{5}{6}\).
