To solve this, we can use basic probability and consider the possible outcomes for the genders of the two children.

Assume that both children are equally likely to be boys or girls. Without any additional information, the possible combinations of the two children are:

1. Boy (B), Boy (B)
2. Boy (B), Girl (G)
3. Girl (G), Boy (B)
4. Girl (G), Girl (G)

However, we are given that **at least one child is a boy**, so we can eliminate the possibility of both children being girls (Girl, Girl). This leaves us with the following possible outcomes:

1. Boy (B), Boy (B)
2. Boy (B), Girl (G)
3. Girl (G), Boy (B)

Out of these three remaining possibilities, only one corresponds to both children being boys: (Boy, Boy).

Thus, the probability that both children are boys, given that at least one is a boy, is:

\[
\frac{1}{3}
\]

So the correct answer is **1/3**.
