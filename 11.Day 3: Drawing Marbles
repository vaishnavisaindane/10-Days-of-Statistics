Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the situation

- There are **3 red marbles** and **4 blue marbles** in the bag. 
- In total, there are **7 marbles** (3 red + 4 blue).
- You are drawing **2 marbles** from the bag **without replacement**.
- The first marble drawn is red, and you want to find the probability that the second marble drawn is blue.

### Step 2: Analyze the situation after the first draw

Since the first marble drawn is **red**, after this draw:
- The number of marbles left in the bag is **6** (7 total marbles minus the 1 red marble drawn).
- The number of **blue marbles left** is still **4** because none of the blue marbles were drawn yet.

### Step 3: Calculate the probability
Now, you want to find the probability that the second marble drawn is **blue**.

The total number of possible outcomes for the second draw is **6** (since there are 6 marbles left in the bag).

Out of these 6 marbles, **4 are blue**. Therefore, the probability that the second marble is blue is:

{Number of blue marbles left}
____________________________________
t{Total number of marbles left}} 

= 4
_______
   6

= 2/3


### Final Answer:
The probability that the second marble is blue, given that the first marble drawn was red, is **2/3**.
